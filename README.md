- **Products.csv**: Product catalog with categories and pricing
- **Transactions.csv**: Detailed transaction records

## Key Features
- Regional spending pattern analysis
- Product category performance evaluation
- Customer segmentation
- Temporal transaction analysis
- Seasonal trend identification

## Technical Stack
